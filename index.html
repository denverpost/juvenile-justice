		<p class="lead">Inside his prison cell, Gabriel Adams could at long last see a different future.</p>
		<p>He had spent more than half of his life behind bars because, when he was 17, he helped <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/news/violence/viol0213a.htm">a friend shoot and stab his mother and stepfather</a> to death. Tried as an adult, he received an adult&rsquo;s sentence: life in prison with no opportunity for release.</p>
		<p>Outside, other kids his age graduated high school and entered college. They bought their first beers and drank toasts at their weddings.</p>
		<p>Then, in 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional to treat juvenile murderers like adults because, regardless of how heinous their crimes are, juveniles think differently. Many states changed their sentencing rules to give juvenile murderers a second chance, but Colorado hesitated.</p>
		<p>Adams waited, and his life unspooled one day at a time. By March 9, 2014, the 38-year-old Adams felt there was no hope left. Inside his prison cell, he slipped a makeshift rope around his neck, pulling the noose tight.</p>
		<p>Adams <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/26/man-convicted-in-double-murder-at-18-commits-suicide-in-prison/">died waiting</a>. There are 48 others like him in Colorado, still waiting.</p>
		<p>In Colorado, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2006/02/18/teen-crime-adult-time-2/">48 inmates are serving automatic sentences of life without parole</a> for murders committed when they were juveniles. The state&rsquo;s slow response to addressing such sentences has been torturous for both victims and inmates awaiting a resolution.</p>
		<p>For some inmates, the uncertainty fueled drug abuse and suicide attempts inside prison. At some point, many of the 48 told their attorneys to stop coming to spare them the disappointment.</p>
		<p>But there&rsquo;s no release for victims, either. Decades after their children, parents and spouses were killed, families are still reeling. As they worked to rebuild their lives, they were also repeatedly asked to share their pain in order to keep the murderers behind bars.</p>
		<p>This year looked like it would finally bring resolution.</p>
		<p>First, a January ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court extended the reach of the court&rsquo;s 2012 ruling, effectively ensuring that any automatic life sentence handed down to a juvenile will undergo a review.</p>

			<p class="caption"><span class="captionhed">Senate hearing</span> Supporters and opponents of bills requiring sentencing reviews for those sentenced to life in prison for crimes committed as juveniles share their opinions at a committee hearing in the spring of 2016.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Then, the legislature <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/16/bill-aims-to-streamline-review-cases-of-48-juveniles-sentenced-to-life/">took up two bills</a> to decide what those reviews would look like in Colorado.</p>
		<p>The bills, introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, eliminate the life sentence, and &mdash; at a minimum &mdash; require that the remaining 48 lifers be re-sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after serving 40 years. Some could be eligible for parole after serving 30 years or even sooner.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s because, for the first time, any juvenile convicted of murder will be eligible for earned time in prison.</p>
		<p>The provision <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/05/02/accusations-fly-around-bill-for-reviews-of-48-juveniles-serving-life/">sparked an outcry</a> by some of the state&rsquo;s district attorneys who called the earned time &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; and &ldquo;disgusting.&rdquo; They warned it could lead to the release of inmates who committed murders.</p>
		<p>Still, the bills breezed through the legislature and were signed into law.</p>
		<p>Many consider the reviews a step toward freedom, but they may end up being the prelude to another fight.</p>
		<p>How the reviews will work and how quickly they will happen remains unclear. Parole eligibility doesn&rsquo;t guarantee release. Some defense attorneys worry another disappointment could be devastating for their clients.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Denver District Attorney Mitchell Morrissey &mdash; whose district will handle the most reviews &mdash; said he is working with his appellate division and potentially the Colorado Attorney General&rsquo;s office to challenge the constitutionality of giving inmates retroactive earned time. If he does, a ruling could be years away.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work fast,&rdquo; Morrissey said.</p>

Dixon was selling Selectman a bag of pot, but the deal spiraled out of control and left Dixon dead on the sidewalk. Selectman was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Every time an appeal comes up in Selectman&rsquo;s case or new legislation is drafted to change his sentence, Hardy&rsquo;s heart breaks all over again, she said.</p>
		<p>Hardy, her grandson and her great-grandson were among more than a dozen families to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/20/colorado-bill-for-reviews-of-48-juveniles-sentenced-to-life-passes-first-round/">testify against the new law</a> this spring. Every time Hardy has to ask that Selectman&rsquo;s sentence be left alone, it feels like another brush stroke painting her as the villain.</p>
		<p>Under the Colorado Victims Rights Act, crime victims have a right to be present and heard when an offender&rsquo;s sentence is discussed. Hardy and other victims say even though the new law requires victims&rsquo; opinions be considered during a review, their voices are still being silenced.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Everybody seems to forget with these Supreme Court rulings, they don&rsquo;t change the fact that they are guilty. They are guilty of taking a life,&rdquo; said Jody Robinson, president of the National Organization for Victims of Juvenile Murders.</p>
		<p>Since the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling in January, membership to the victims rights and support group has doubled. Some victims called in the middle of panic attacks and became physically ill after learning about the opinion, Robinson said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going back to court,&rdquo; said Robinson, whose brother was murdered by a juvenile in Michigan 26 years ago.</p>

		<p>Twenty-two years after her son&rsquo;s murder, Hardy still paces in her bedroom during sleepless nights. A photo of her son holding his 3-month-old baby &mdash; the grandson she helped raised &mdash; watches over her from her dresser.</p>
		<p>She&rsquo;s memorized all the ways to get to work without having to drive by the lot in Aurora where Dixon was killed. She still has the high school diploma she collected for her son and the calendar he wrote everyone&rsquo;s birthday in.</p>
		<p>A letter Selectmen sent her late last year also sits in the bedroom. Opened and unread.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to say I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; Hardy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in prison, too. I got a life sentence, but I don&rsquo;t get to parole from it. I don&rsquo;t get to be free.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of John Leonardelli. Johnson was 17 when he watched 19-year-old Johnathan Jordan &mdash; who has since written a letter claiming responsibility &mdash; stab Leonardelli to death in an Aurora parking garage in 1994. The two left in the 55-year-old&rsquo;s Jaguar and took his watch, bracelet and ring.</p>

		<p>Now, 39, Johnson never learned to drive. He&rsquo;s never voted in an election. Instead, he studied Supreme Court decisions and case-law.</p>
		<p>Six years before the U.S. Supreme Court found automatic life sentences for juveniles to be unconstitutional, Colorado legislators passed a law eliminating them. But a clause that would have made the law retroactive was removed after Gov. Bill Owens raised concerns for the victims&rsquo; families.</p>
		<p>In June 2014, the Colorado Supreme Court heard arguments in four cases involving juvenile defendants. Attorneys for the men claimed the sentences of life without parole were unconstitutional under the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2012 ruling.</p>
		<p>State justices &mdash; who acknowledged there had been little direction from lawmakers on how to address those cases &mdash; ruled two of those four cases should be reviewed. Those reviews have yet to be completed.</p>
		<p>Johnson was 18 when he went to prison. During his second night of lockup he watched another man unsuccessfully try to fight off a rapist. As he waded into the first years of his sentence, he dove deeper into depression.</p>
		<p>One night he cut his wrist with a razor blade.</p>
		<p>Eventually, it was too much and Johnson turned to one of few escapes available to him behind bars &mdash; heroin. Each hit, which he calls a &ldquo;shot,&rdquo; was bigger than the last.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think I was hoping that one day one of those shots would just put me down,&rdquo; Johnson said.</p>

		<p>John Johnson watched his son grow up in prison visiting rooms. He&rsquo;s confident his son will never give up, but he worries that he and others feel forgotten. He thinks about it every time he says goodbye.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know. Is this the last hug? Or will he still be there,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s brutal.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Mike Leonardelli, John Leonardelli&rsquo;s son, also knows how hard goodbyes are.</p>
		<p>He had to watch as his mother, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, repeatedly asked where his father was. She died two years to the day after her husband.</p>
		<p>Then Leonardelli watched one brother die of alcohol abuse, then another from drugs.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Dad was the rock of the family,&rdquo; Leonardelli said. After his death everyone scattered.</p>

		<p>The family wanted the death penalty, and now they want the original sentence to stand. He cringes when he hears people call Johnson&rsquo;s sentence &ldquo;cruel and unusual.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more cruel and unusual than killing somebody,&rdquo; Leonardelli said. &ldquo;Why does he get that consideration when my dad never did?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Jeff Johnson asks himself the same question all the time.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do what a man should have done,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t react the way I should have reacted, and I didn&rsquo;t make the right decisions after that either.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Johnson remembers the day he realized he might die in prison. It was the day he quit using drugs and started working toward becoming a role model for other inmates and at-risk youth. It was the day he decided to leave a different mark, something other than that night in the Aurora parking garage.</p>

			<p class="caption"><span class="photog">Lindsay Pierce, The Denver Post</span> John Johnson has long advocated for his son, Jeffrey Johnson, who will now get a new sentencing review. Whether Jeffrey or his co-defendant committed the murder has been contested since the trial, but within the last few years his co-defendant has claimed responsibility for the murder.</p>
		</div>
		<p>But he is careful not to fill in details when imagining his future. He pictures one day having a wife, maybe a son whose hockey team he could coach. That&rsquo;s as far as he goes.</p>
		<p>Since 2012, 24 states have changed sentencing laws for juveniles convicted of murder, according to a report from The Sentencing Project.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;States have been passing laws in efforts to comply with this because they have realized that children are different than adults,&rdquo; said Nikola Nable-Juris, policy counsel for the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth.</p>
		<p>Colorado now joins a minority of states, including Texas and Nevada, that require the longest sentence before the juvenile offenders can become parole eligible. Other states allow juvenile offenders to become parole eligible after serving 15 to 25 years, Nable-Juris said.</p>
		<p>Under the new law, if Johnson is released he will be placed on parole for the rest of his life. After watching friends repeatedly return to prison for violations, Johnson worries that perpetual parole will set him up to fail.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It might be nice to try to go make a life,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s kind of like saying you don&rsquo;t miss nothing you never had.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly found that juveniles should be treated differently from adults because they think differently. In 2012, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that adolescence is marked by &ldquo;rashness, proclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Portions of the brain that control planning, reasoning and judgment are not fully developed in juveniles in their late teens, said Dr. David Fassler, who is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;As a result, adolescents use their brains in fundamentally different ways than adults,&rdquo; said Fassler, who has studied brain development in juvenile offenders. &ldquo;They are more likely to act on impulse or to be influenced by peers, and less likely to stop, think things through, or fully consider the consequences of their actions.&rdquo;</p>

		</div>
		<p>Greg Romero was 17 and so drunk the night of the murders he never thought of the consequences. He doesn&rsquo;t even remember pulling the trigger, he said.</p>
		<p>So, Romero can&rsquo;t recall the shot he fired into 17-year-old Terrance Mayo&rsquo;s chest in 1995. He doesn&rsquo;t know if he watched his friend fire multiple rounds into the quivering bed sheet that Rachelle Peterson, 16 and pregnant, was hiding under.</p>
		<p>But it haunts him.</p>
		<p>After serving 20 years in prison, the now 38-year-old has fine gray hairs sprinkled around his temples. Romero shakes his head as he describes the life he was leading before that night.</p>
		<p>Romero was convicted of first-degree murder for the 1995 deaths of Mayo and Peterson. He was sentenced to serve two lifetime sentences.</p>
		<p>But the gravity of his sentence didn&rsquo;t set in at trial, Romero said. It didn&rsquo;t set in during his sentencing and he thought he would eventually get to go home when he arrived at prison. It wasn&rsquo;t until he was sitting alone in administrative segregation that it hit Romero.</p>
		<p>He was going to die here.</p>
		<p>So Romero &ldquo;camouflaged&rdquo; himself with drugs, gangs and tattoos. It took him years to grow up, he said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I realized that it didn&rsquo;t matter that I may not get out of prison,&rdquo; Romero said. &ldquo;I wanted to be a different kind of person. Whether I was in here or not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The ability of juveniles to rehabilitate is also something the Supreme Court says sets them apart. Settings with structure, predictability and caring role models provide the best environment for rehabilitation, Fassler said.</p>
		<p>When Romero thinks of the life Mayo and Peterson were trying to build together, his eyes well up with tears. He uses that thought every day to keep him on track as he works on youth outreach programs and mentors other inmates.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;That thought pops up in your head. That maybe it&rsquo;s just a mirage,&rdquo; Romero said. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t let yourself dwell on that for very long cause you gotta keep that hope. You gotta keep that faith that something is going to change.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But Denver DA Morrissey says not all crimes can be redeemed.</p>
		<p>Colorado&rsquo;s new law goes one step further than the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling, which banned automatic life sentences but said they may be used in the rarest of circumstances. Currently 32 states still allow juveniles to be sentenced to life without parole for murder.</p>
		<p>Life without parole is no longer an option in Colorado, but Morrissey says Romero&rsquo;s case is an example of why it should be.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This was cold-blooded murder,&rdquo; Morrissey said.</p>

		<p>On Dec. 21, 1995, the toddler was sitting in the back seat of a parked car when he was killed during a drive-by-shooting in Denver. Casson took his last breath in his mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
		<p>That night, before she learned that two teenagers were responsible for her son&rsquo;s death, Evans wept on her mother&rsquo;s bathroom floor. But between her sobs and disbelief, Evans said God asked her a question: Will you forgive?</p>
		<p>She answered yes.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not normal to feel that way about someone who took the life of your child,&rdquo; Evans said. &ldquo;To lose a child is the worst hurt, the worst thing that can happen to an individual.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>That loss is why Evans knows her path is not for everyone. But her survival was dependent on forgiveness, she said.</p>
		<p>Her forgiveness <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2012/07/09/denver-woman-feels-the-power-of-restorative-justice-after-son-murdered/">led her to Raymond Johnson</a>, the man who was 16 when he fired the bullet that killed Casson. After meeting Johnson and sharing letters, Evans considers him a son and she is &ldquo;ashamed&rdquo; at the delay in changing the now 37-year-old&rsquo;s sentence.</p>

		<p>Giselle Gutierrez-Ruiz, one of four juvenile lifers Ratliff represents, glued his digital watch face on a painting he sent to Ratliff after she took on his case in 2011. Gutierrez-Ruiz set the alarm to go off at lockdown and every day it reminds Ratliff that her client is settling in for another night in prison.</p>

		<p>On Oct. 17, 1997, Gutierrez-Ruiz got into a car with a man he barely knew. As Gutierrez-Ruiz was driving 70 mph, Abel Martinez-Sanchez suddenly started firing a gun out of the passenger-side window. Days later, Gutierrez-Ruiz learned that one of those shots killed Rumaldo Castillo-Hernandez.</p>

		<p>A jury convicted Gutierrez-Ruiz of first-degree murder and he received an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I just wish I could reverse it,&rdquo; Gutierrez-Ruiz, now 36, said in the visiting room at the Limon Correctional Facility.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s what Ratliff has spent years trying to do. Like many of the 48 cases she&rsquo;s studied, Gutierrez-Ruiz&rsquo; representation failed to meet standards for representing juveniles, she said. One guideline said attorneys should meet with their clients at least once a week.</p>
		<p>From start to finish, Gutierrez-Ruiz&rsquo;s attorneys did not spend more than five hours with the 17-year-old outside of the courtroom.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The defense basically rolled over and gave up,&rdquo; said Dave Thomas, one of the jurors who served during Gutierrez-Ruiz&rsquo;s trial.</p>
		<p>Thomas said he stands by the guilty verdict, but he and other jurors were &ldquo;floored&rdquo; when they found out the automatic sentence for the man who was driving the car was life in prison without parole. Now, Thomas believes Gutierrez-Ruiz has served more time than his crime warranted.</p>
		<p>But Gutierrez-Ruiz tries not to think about the time he&rsquo;s spent in prison. He&rsquo;s careful not to ponder the possibility of his release or life on the outside.</p>
